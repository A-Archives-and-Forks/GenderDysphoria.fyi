# Hormone Replacement Therapy 101

**Preface**: This post is written for Transfeminine and Transmasculine individuals seeking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Not every trans person pursues medical treatment for their gender dysphoria, and not all trans people experience physical dysphoria. Additionally, feminisation/masculinization is *not the only reason* to pursue hormone therapy. For those who experience biochemical gender dysphoria, switching hormone profiles significantly improves mental health and mental acuity.

Unfortunately, the reality of being trans is that we often have to be our own self advocates when it comes to our medical care. A *lot* of medical providers have no idea how medical transition works, and even many endocrinologists are woefully out of date on modern treatment plans. It is extremely beneficial to go into your first HRT appointment well informed and well armed. This guide will *attempt* to cover everything you need to know about hormone therapy, and a lot you probably donâ€™t need to know but is good to be aware of.

Note, this is not a guide on how to self-medicate. You should always seek proper and licensed medical professionals to assist you with your transition. In many countries it is possible to find Informed Consent clinics which will assist you with medical transition without the need of a formal diagnoses. [Erin Reed](https://rewire.news/article/2019/10/16/meet-the-woman-making-it-easier-for-trans-people-around-the-country-to-get-hormones/) maintains an excellent [map of all Informed Consent clinics within the United States](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=42.47025816653197%2C-97.03854516744877&z=4).
